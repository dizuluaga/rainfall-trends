This repository contains the final document of the research project <i>"Long-term trends in monthly precipitation over Colombia"</i>.

<h2>Abstract</h2>
The Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) was applied to 25,521 series of monthly precipitation over Colombia during 2000-2021 provided by The Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM). The resulting long-term trends from the EMD process were analyzed using the modified Mann-Kendall test to determine their sign and statistical significance, and the Theil-Sen estimator to quantify their magnitude. The analyzes were carried out: (1) on the complete series, (2) on the series averaged monthly and (3) on the series averaged quarterly (D-J-F, M-A-M, J-J-A and S-O-N). Most of the series (more than 50%) did not present statistically significant trends with a 95% confidence interval. Among the significant trends there were positive and negative trends throughout the territory, although the latter predominated. The strongest negative trends occurred in the Colombian Pacific. Past evidence and that presented in this study show that there is no uniform spatial and temporal pattern in long-term trends in precipitation over Colombia. Additional analyze that allow differentiating between long-term periodicities and the real effect of Climate Change on Colombia's hydroclimatology are necessary.
